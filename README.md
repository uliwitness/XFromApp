XFromApp
========

Old source code to run HyperCard or SuperCard XCMDs and XFCNs on Classic MacOS and Carbon. Also includes source code for the glue code you would nead to compile an XCMD or XFCN, like shipped by Apple and Silicon Beach in HyperXCmdLib etc.

For the original Readme file with documentation, see !Docs.txt.

This is the original 2000s-era source code, also seen under the name "C++ XFromApp". The only changes made were that I checked in compressed copies of the CodeWarrior projects and resource files, in the hope that their resource forks will thus survive the checkin into git.


Note on FakeHandles
-------------------

If you are looking for a way to emulate Mac Handles on another platform that doesn't have a native implementation, there is a newer version of that code as part of my ReClassicfication project at <https://github.com/uliwitness/ReClassicfication>.
