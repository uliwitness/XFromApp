C++ X-FROM-APP DOCUMENTATIONWHAT IS IT?XFromApp is an XCMD engine. It implements the XCMD protocol used for extendingthe syntax of certain programming languages (in particular, the xTalk family oflanguages like HyperTalk, SuperTalk or MetaTalk). XCMDs are code resourcescontaining executable code. They are called in response to a command from ahost application and then perform some action and optionally make somecallbacks to the host application.C++ XFromApp is a complete rewrite of the original XFromApp code (which usedto be based on Laurent Humbert's XCMDsFromApp code). It is written mostly inANSI C++ (or at least what CodeWarrior thinks that is) with portability toother platforms as a central goal. It uses an approach introduced by OMO(Oracle Media Objects, another HyperCard clone) to simulate Macintosh Handleson other platforms to make it possible to port ANSI XCMDs to other platformswith a minimal amount of changes.WHAT CAN IT DO?The features I can claim XFromApp to have with a straight face are:- Full compatibility with HyperCard 1.2 and SuperCard XCMDs (when running pre-Carbon).- Support for PowerPC native 'xcmd' and 'xfcn'-style externals (pre-Carbon).- Support for Supercard's new Carbon-native 'Xcmd' and 'Xfcn'-style	externals. (i.e. OS X externals)- Object-oriented plug-in architecture to easily install any	desired subset of callbacks. (This could include the HyperCard	2.x callbacks if you're willing to write the implementation)- Use of "fake" Handles on other platforms and of Macintosh Handles	on MacOS provides maximum compatibility while working around	the problem of strings containing NULL characters.- Includes XCMD header file with full source code for the glue code	to facilitate development of XCMDs and XFCNs that adapt their	behaviour when running under different engines.HOW DO THE NEW CARBON XCMDS WORK?Due to restrictions of the MacOS X runtime architecture, XCMDs need to berecompiled and modified to link against CarbonLib to run under MacOS X orMacOS 8.x with CarbonLib. Apart from the changes you might need to maketo carbonize your XCMD, you will be able to use your XCMD unchanged, asthe actual protocol has not changed. To distinguish them from Classic680x0 XCMDs and the newer, PowerPC-native xcmds, the new kind of XCMD hasthe type code Xcmd resp. Xfcn.HOW DOES THE EXAMPLE CARBON XCMD PROJECT WORK?Pretty much like previous ones. The only difference is that, instead oflinking with HyperXLib or SuperXCmd.h/SuperXCmd.c, you link toCarbonXCmd.h/.c (and optionally to SuperXLib.c/.h if you want to make anexternal that will also work in SuperCard). CROSS PLATFORM XCMDS? IS THIS REALLY POSSIBLE?Depends on what you need. XFromApp will not, or rather, can not give youXCMDs that are compiled on one platform and then run on all other ones. Theleast you need to do is recompile your XCMD on the new platform you want todeploy on. However, if you stick to a command set that is available on allplatforms you wish to deploy on (a good candidate is the ANSI C/C++standard), you can keep the effort involved at this level. You will nothave to rewrite your external for this other platform.LIMITATIONS IN THIS RELEASE:The first release of C++ XFromApp is still missing a number of theHyperCard 1.2 callbacks, nor does it include any dummy objects for theSuperCard callbacks and HyperCard 2.x callbacks included in releases of theold procedural-C XFromApp. These will be added in future releases if enoughinterest exists.AUTHOR & COPYRIGHT:C++ XFromApp was written and is (c) Copyright 1999-2002 by M.
